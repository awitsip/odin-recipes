            <li>Once the steak hits the 115 internal temp set your grill to high heat</li>
            <li>Sear the steak directly over the heat source flipping every minute until the char is to your liking</li>
            <li>Remove the steak when it hits 135 degrees internally, you may need to finish cooking over indirect heat to get to 135 internal</li>
            <li>Let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Slice against the grain and enjoy!</li>
